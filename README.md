# Simple Calc Mod for Balamod

## How to Install:

1. **Install Balamod:** Ensure you have Balamod installed.
   
2. **Copy Files:** Copy `simple_calc.lua` into your Balamod "mods" directory.

3. **Start Balatro:** Launch Balatro.

4. **Enable Score Counter:** While running, press the "C" button to enable or disable the score counter.

5. **View Score:** The mod should automatically display the calculated score in the top right corner of your screen.

## Note:

- **Random Events:** Random events such as lucky cards are calculated only once. Therefore, there's no way to determine your "average score."

- **Prototype:** Please note that this is just a prototype. Scaling jokers are not yet implemented, and many tests have not been completed.
