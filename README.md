How to install:

Balamod must first be installed.

Copy simple_calc.lua into your balamod "mods" directory.  

Start Balatro

When runnning, press the "C" button to enable and disable the score counter

Mod should automatically display the calculated score in the top right.

Note:  Random events (lucky cards, etc.) are calculated only once.  There is no way to know your "average score"

Finally, scaling jokers are not yet implemented, and many tests have not yet been completed.  This is just a prototype.

TODO:
[] Cleanup Code
[] Beautify the output
[] Add scaling jokers
